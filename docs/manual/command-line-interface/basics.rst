Like with many other tools, ``git ws`` works with sub-commands, i.e. the first argument is usually the name of a sub-command to run. Also as with other tools, you can usually get quick help on the command line by calling the tool (or any of it's sub-commands) with the ``--help`` flag. Calling e.g. ``git ws --help`` will produce the following output:

.. include:: ../../static/cli.txt
    :code: bash

In the following, the various commands available are explained in detail.
