Usage: git-ws config get [OPTIONS] OPTION

  Get the value of a configuration option.

  This prints the value of the specified option. If selected, the value of a
  specific configuration file will be read. Otherwise, the computed value of
  the configuration option is shown.

  The computed configuration value is created by merging the system, user and
  workspace configuration files in that order. On top, environment variables
  of the form GIT_WS_XXX (where XXX is the name of an option) can be used to
  override settings from the configuration files.

  Note that option also can be a user specific option from one of the
  configuration files that is not otherwise consumed by GitWS itself.

Options:
  --system                  Operate on system wide configuration.
  --user                    Operate on user configuration.
  --workspace               Operate on workspace specific configuration.
  -f, --format [text|json]  The format to use for showing values.
  -h, --help                Show this message and exit.
