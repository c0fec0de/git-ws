Usage: git-ws config list [OPTIONS]

  List all configuration options.

  This prints all configuration options. If selected, only the options from a
  specific configuration file will be shown. Otherwise, the computed list of
  configuration values is shown.

  The computed  configuration is created by merging the system, user and
  workspace configuration files in that order. On top, environment variables
  of the form GIT_WS_XXX (where XXX is the name of an option) can be used to
  override settings from the configuration files.

  Note that the listing might contain extra arguments if specified in one of
  the configuration files.

Options:
  -f, --format [text|json]  The format to use for showing values.
  --system                  Operate on system wide configuration.
  --user                    Operate on user configuration.
  --workspace               Operate on workspace specific configuration.
  -h, --help                Show this message and exit.
